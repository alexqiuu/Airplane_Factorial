# Paper Airplane Experiment: A Factorial Design on Flight Distance

## Overview  
This project investigates how the **placement of paper clips** on a paper airplane impacts flight distance. Using a **$2^3$ full factorial design**, the study evaluates aerodynamic performance across eight weight configurations in a controlled indoor setting.

## Methodology  

This study followed a controlled factorial experiment using a **$2^3$ between-subjects design** to explore how **clip placement on the nose, middle, and rear** affects distance traveled.

### Trials  
- **8 unique treatment combinations** from three binary factors  
- **3 replicates per treatment** â†’ 24 trials total  
- Trials conducted in random order to minimize bias

### Experimental Factors  
- **Clip on Nose (2 levels):**
  - *Present*
  - *Absent*  
- **Clip on Middle (2 levels):**
  - *Present*
  - *Absent*  
- **Clip on Rear (2 levels):**
  - *Present*
  - *Absent*  

### Controls  
- All planes constructed identically from the same template  
- Tosses executed by the same individual using a consistent motion  
- Environment: Indoor hallway with no wind interference  
- Flight distance measured using iPhone's built-in measuring app  
- Planes repaired or replaced after damage to maintain consistency  

### Procedure  
- Each configuration tested 3 times  
- Paper airplane was restored to its original condition after each flight  
- Data logged manually after each toss  

### Analysis  
- A linear model with interaction terms was fitted to predict flight distance  
- Assumptions (normality, independence, homoscedasticity) were validated  
- Post-hoc power analysis was conducted using a custom R simulation script  

## Results  

The linear model analysis revealed how different clip placements affected flight distance.

### Main Findings  
- **Nose clip** significantly increased flight distance  
  - *p* = 0.020  
  - Estimated increase of **+9.47 units**
- **Middle clip** also improved distance  
  - *p* = 0.017  
  - Estimated increase of **+9.77 units**
- **Rear clip** significantly reduced distance  
  - *p* = 0.021  
  - Estimated decrease of **âˆ’9.37 units**

### Interaction Effects  
- **Nose Ã— Middle**: significant negative interaction  
  - *p* = 0.031  
  - Suggests overweighting the front half impairs flight
- **Other interactions** were not statistically significant  
  - Nose Ã— Rear: *p* = 0.584  
  - Middle Ã— Rear: *p* = 0.133  
  - 3-way interaction: *p* = 0.062 (marginal)

### Model Performance & Power  
- **Overall model p-value**: < 0.001  
- **Post-hoc power analysis**:  
  - Achieved statistical power = **0.823** with 24 trials  
  - Confirms adequacy of sample size and design  

### Assumption Checks  
- **Shapiro-Wilk test**: *p* = 0.991 â†’ residuals are normally distributed  
- **Residual vs. Fitted plot**: showed no pattern, confirming homoscedasticity  
- **QQ plot & histogram**: confirmed bell-shaped distribution
