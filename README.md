Designed and executed a 2³ full factorial experiment to evaluate how weight distribution—via paper clip placement on the nose, middle, and rear—impacts flight distance. Conducted 24 randomized trials in a controlled indoor setting, ensuring consistent launch force and airplane condition. Modeled results using a linear regression framework with interaction terms in R, verified assumptions with residual diagnostics, and performed power analysis (82% power) to validate design sufficiency. Identified significant main and interaction effects, offering insights into flight stability and aerodynamic efficiency.
